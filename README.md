## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I had a lot of difficulty learning CSS Grid to display the desktop view, but after finding the grid generator and reading the docs I was able to better grasp how grid layouts work. I also learned how to pass props from a React component to a styled-component.

### Continued development

I really wanted to figure out how to set the desktop layout using flexbox, but was not able to, so I plan to continue to practice flexbox to be able to do more in the future.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Generator](https://cssgridgenerator.io/) - This helped me create a CSS grid for the desktop layout.
- [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#passed-props) - The docs helped me understand how to pass props to a styled-component from a React component.
